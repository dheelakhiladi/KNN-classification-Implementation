Rather disguising repository name, this repo has both algorithms KNN and KMeans which has same basic principle but works on entirely different catagories KNN is supervised learnig and other is unsupervised but both finds nearsest neighbors and labeling them accordingly, but first one is used for regression and other one is for clustering this has been done using python and scikitlearn library, to draw a comparision.
